# 🔐 Security GRC Automation Lab

## 🚀 Overview

The **Security GRC Automation Lab** is a hands-on project that simulates how modern security teams automate **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** processes using **Python and Elasticsearch**.

This lab demonstrates how **risk data, evidence, and controls** can be ingested, correlated, analyzed, and reported automatically—similar to real-world enterprise GRC platforms.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

* **Python** – Automation & data processing
* **Elasticsearch** – Risk and evidence storage & search
* **Kibana** – Visualization and monitoring
* **Git & GitHub** – Version control and collaboration
* **ISO/IEC 27001** – Control mapping & compliance alignment

---

## ✨ Key Features

* ✅ Automated **Risk Register Ingestion**
* ✅ **Evidence Management** and indexing
* ✅ **High-Risk Detection & Alerting**
* ✅ **Risk ↔ Control Correlation (ISO 27001)**
* ✅ **Automated Compliance Reporting** (CSV / XLSX)
* ✅ **Security-focused Alerting & Notifications**

---

## 🧩 Project Phases

1. **Elasticsearch & Kibana Setup**
2. **Risk Register Ingestion**
3. **Evidence Ingestion**
4. **Risk–Control Correlation Logic**
5. **Automated GRC Reporting**
6. **High-Risk Detection & Alerting**
7. **Monitoring & Operational Validation**

Each phase builds on the previous one, mimicking how GRC automation evolves in real organizations.
