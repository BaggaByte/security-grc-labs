# 🔐 Security GRC Automation Lab

## 🚀 Overview

The **Security GRC Automation Lab** is a hands-on project that demonstrates how modern security teams automate **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** workflows using **Python** and **Elasticsearch**.

This project simulates real-world GRC operations such as risk ingestion, evidence management, control mapping, automated reporting, and high-risk alerting—similar to capabilities found in enterprise GRC platforms.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

* **Python** – Automation, data processing, and alerting
* **Elasticsearch** – Risk and evidence indexing & search
* **Kibana** – Monitoring, validation, and visualization
* **Git & GitHub** – Version control and project management
* **ISO/IEC 27001** – Control mapping and compliance alignment

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Automated **Risk Register Ingestion**
* Evidence management and indexing
* **High-Risk Detection & Alerting**
* Risk ↔ Control correlation (ISO 27001)
* Automated compliance reporting (CSV / XLSX)
* Security-focused alerting and notifications

---

## 🧩 Project Phases

1. Elasticsearch & Kibana Setup
2. Risk Register Ingestion
3. Evidence Ingestion
4. Risk–Control Correlation Logic
5. Automated GRC Reporting
6. High-Risk Detection & Alerting
7. Monitoring & Operational Validation

Each phase builds on the previous one, mirroring how GRC automation evolves in real organizations.
