🔐 Security GRC Automation Lab
🚀 Overview

The Security GRC Automation Lab is a hands-on project that simulates how modern security teams automate Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) processes using Python and Elasticsearch.

This lab demonstrates how risk data, evidence, and controls can be ingested, correlated, analyzed, and reported automatically—similar to real-world enterprise GRC platforms.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python – automation & data processing

Elasticsearch – risk and evidence storage & search

Kibana – visualization and monitoring

Git & GitHub – version control and collaboration

ISO/IEC 27001 – control mapping & compliance alignment

✨ Key Features

✔ Automated Risk Register Ingestion
✔ Evidence Management and indexing
✔ High-Risk Detection & Alerting
✔ Risk ↔ Control Correlation (ISO 27001)
✔ Automated Compliance Reporting (CSV / XLSX)
✔ Security-focused Alerting & Notifications

🧩 Project Phases
