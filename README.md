🔐 Security GRC Automation Lab
🚀 Overview

The Security GRC Automation Lab is a hands-on project that simulates how modern security teams automate Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) processes using Python and Elasticsearch.

This lab demonstrates how risk data, evidence, and controls can be ingested, correlated, analyzed, and reported automatically—similar to real-world enterprise GRC platforms.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

->Python – Automation & data processing
->Elasticsearch – Risk and evidence storage & search
->Kibana – Visualization and monitoring
->Git & GitHub – Version control and collaboration
->ISO/IEC 27001 – Control mapping & compliance alignment

✨ Key Features

✅ Automated Risk Register Ingestion
✅ Evidence Management and indexing
✅ High-Risk Detection & Alerting
✅ Risk ↔ Control Correlation (ISO 27001)
✅ Automated Compliance Reporting (CSV / XLSX)
✅ Security-focused Alerting & Notifications

🧩 Project Phases

->Elasticsearch & Kibana Setup
->Risk Register Ingestion
->Evidence Ingestion
->Risk–Control Correlation Logic
->Automated GRC Reporting
->High-Risk Detection & Alerting
->Monitoring & Operational Validation

Each phase builds on the previous one, mimicking how GRC automation evolves in real organizations.

📊 Example Use Cases

->Identify and track high-impact security risks
->Map risks to ISO 27001 controls
->Automate compliance evidence collection
->Generate executive-ready risk & compliance reports
->Detect and alert on critical risks in near real-time

🎯 Who This Project Is For

->Security Engineers
->GRC Analysts
->Risk Managers
->Compliance Professionals
->SOC & Blue Team Practitioners
->Students & Professionals learning Security Automation
